= A RISC-V C/Assembly Development Playground with QEMU

== Introduction

This project serves as a demo project to facilitate learning RISC-V assembly.

This project will be compiled as a riscv63-linux-gnu ELF executable, which will be run by the qemu-riscv64-static, aka. QEMU User Space Emulator.

== Directory Structure
----
.vscode/      VS Code Workspace Files
src/          Source files, including .c and .S files
build/        Object files and linked final ELF main.elf
Makefile      Main Makefile
README.adoc   This document
----

== How to Add Source Files and Compile
. Adding source files as .c or .S to the src/ directory
  * Note: one of the files must contain `int main(int argc, char *argv[])` symbol for the glibc to pick up
. `$ make all`
. `build/main.elf` will be generated if successful. This is the executable ELF that can be run on the target machine (riscv64-linux-gnu)

== How to Run the Compiled Code
`$ make run`

== How to Connect GDB to QEMU to Debug Interactively
. `$ qemu-riscv64-static -L /usr/riscv64-linux-gnu/ -g 1234 build/main.elf`
. Launch gdb on a seperate terminal: `$ riscv64-linux-gnu-gdb build/main.elf`
. Inside gdb: `target remote localhost:1234`
. Play as usual

== How to use VS Code to Debug Interactively with QEMU
. Open VS Code
. File->Open Folder and choose this directory
. Select "Run and Debug" or press F5
. Play as usual. You can add register watch on the left WATCH panel
  * For example `$pc` to watch PC
